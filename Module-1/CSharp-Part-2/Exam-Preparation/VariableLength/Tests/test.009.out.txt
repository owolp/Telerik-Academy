Now I see fire, inside the mountain, I see fire, burning the trees, And I see fire, hollowing souls, I see fire, blood in the breeze, And I hope that you'll remember me, Oh, should my people fall, Then surely I'll do the same, Confined in mountain halls, We got too close to the flame, Calling out father hold fast and we will, Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side, Desolation comes upon the sky Now I see fire, inside the mountain, I see fire, burning the trees, I see fire, hollowing souls, I see fire, blood in the breeze, And I hope that you'll remember me And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes, For if the dark returns then, My brothers will die, And as the sky's falling down, It crashed into this lonely town, And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screaming out, Now I see fire, inside the mountain, I see fire, burning the trees, I see fire, hollowing souls, I see fire, blood in the breeze I see fire, oh you know I saw a city burning (fire), I see fire, feel the heat upon my skin (fire), And I see fire (fire), And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side
