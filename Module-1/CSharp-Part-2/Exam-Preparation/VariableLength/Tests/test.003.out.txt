Here's a thing, the coding algorithm in this task isn't really effective. It's only good for small alphabets (maybe up to 8 characters) or texts where there is a big difference in the occurence of the different characters. If you want good encoding (i.e. compressing) algorithms, check out Shannon-Fano coding (relatively easy to code if you know what recursion is) or the better Huffman coding (very efficient, used in lots of compression software, not much harder to write than Shannon-Fano coding)
