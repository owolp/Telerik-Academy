Bug reports: --------------------
Format: #Bug number - Class name - Bug description
Example: #1 - PartnerBankingService - The variable "money" at line 36 overflows when you try to add more than 2.1 billion dollars.
--------
#1 - CreateStudentCommand does not implement ICommand interface ( engine can only filters through available classes implementing the interface first, then by name)
#2 - Incorrect output on student without marks. According to 01.output.txt , output should be "This student has no marks.", it 's an empty string instead.
#3 - Incorrect parameters in TeacherAddMarkCommand - Execute(), studentId and teacherId are parsed correctly but used in an incorrect order.
#4 - Engine only takes "End" as a stop command ( not END or end )
